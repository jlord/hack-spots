If you want to do your own thing you can give it a callback:\n\n``` js\nroute(req, res, function() {\n\t// no route was matched\n\tres.writeHead(404);\n\tres.end();\n});\n```\n\nYou can also provide a catch-all to a given route that is called if no route was matched:\n\n``` js\nroute.get(function(req, res) {\n\t// called if no other get route matched\n\tres.writeHead(404);\n\tres.end('no GET handler found');\n});\n```",
